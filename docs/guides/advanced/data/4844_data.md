# 4844 blobs and data

In this article, we'll cover how zkSync is using the new blob type transactions (a.k.a 4844 blobs), to send its pubdata to L1.

While there is a lots of material covering details of 4844, in here we'll focus only on the concrete implementations that zkSync uses.

## Pre-4844 -- calldata world.

First, let's talk how the system worked in the pre-4844 world. Rollup was collecing all the pubdata (up to 120kb) - and then sending it as a 'calldata' with the commit transaction.

Inside the transaction, the contract was computing the keccak hash of this data, and providing it as an input to the proving function.
(more correctly, it was persisting it as a part of block commitment, that was later fed as input in the proveBatches).

## Blob transactions (and 4844)

The introduction of 4844 (in January 2024) changed a lot of things:
* blobs have a separate fee market (gas might be cheap, but blobs expensive and vice-versa)
* you have to pay for a full blob (128kb) - no matter how much of that data you'll use (with calldata, you paid only for the bytes that you've used)
* you don't have access to the contents, and you only get these strange KZG commitments and precompiles.


In this article, we'll focus on the third point - how we adopted our system (including proving system) to handle the KZG commitments etc.

First - let's answer an important question - why did they even introduce the commitments, why not just keep using the hashes as before.
The TL;DR answer is - right now, it doesn't give Ethereum much benefit (and they could have stayed with hashes), but with the next release ('full Danksharding'), they commitments are a must, as this will allow a lot more blobs to be added.

Let's go back to our problem statement:

**We have 128kb of data in L2, and we want to prove on L1 that it was correctly 'attached' to L1 (that is - that it was made available).**


We do it in 14 steps:

Inside the prover (most of this is done in either witness generator or a new circuit type 4844):

|step | explanation| 
| -- | --- |
| split data into 4096 uint256 points | |
| create a polynomial going through these points | if this step is confusing, check out [Blobspace 101][blobspace_101] |
| get trusted setup from Ethereum KZG ceremony (a.k.a secret point 's') |  [trusted setup][trusted_setup] |
| compute commitment (`c = p(s)`) | [compute commitment][compute_commitment] |
| compute versioned hash (`vh = hash(c)`) | Ethereum uses versioned hash as it gives more flexibility in the future. (and is 32 bytes vs 48 for commitment) |
| pick a 'random' point x (`x = hash(hash(data) \|\| vh)`) | This is ['Fiat-Shamir' heuristic][fiat_shamir] | 
| compute the value `p(x) = y` | |
| expect that `hash(vh \|\| x \|\| y)` comes as public input to circuit | This depends on [Schwarz-Zippel lemma][schwarz_zippel] - if 2 polynomials are equal in a random point, there are equal everywhere.


Inside the state keeper
|step | explanation| 
| -- | --- |
| Get `c`, `x`, `y`, `blob_proof` from witness generator | |
| Create a new blob transaction type | These have a special `0x3` type|


Then, inside the L1 contract:

|step | explanation| 
| -- | --- |
| get the `c`, `x` and `y` and `blob_proof` | These arive as inputs from [state keeper][executor_inputs]
| get the verification hash (via BLOB_HASH precompile) | `_getBlobVersionedHash` | 
| use a precompile to check that `p(x) == y` using version hash `c` and `blob_proof` | [Precompile][precompile_4844] note, that you don't actually have the full `p` here - this is where the KZG magic happens - basically `blob_proof` has enough info. Similar concept to how 'merkle path' has enough info to prove the existance of the leaf, without you needing to know the whole tree.  |
|pass the `hash(vh \|\| x \|\| y)` as public input to the verifier | We pass it in [`_batchAuxiliaryOutput`][executor_aux]








### Some additional code pointers

Our proof (as a part of the input), expects these 2 additional fields in [Scheduler AUX inputs][scheduler_aux]
```rust
pub struct BlockAuxilaryOutput<F: SmallField> {
    // ...
    pub eip4844_linear_hashes: [[UInt8<F>; 32]; MAX_4844_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK],
    // these are:  keccak(versioned hash || opening point || evaluation value)
    pub eip4844_output_commitment_hashes: [[UInt8<F>; 32]; MAX_4844_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK],
}

```

We prepare this object inside the [Executor.sol][executor_aux]:
```solidity
bytes32 auxiliaryOutputHash = keccak256(
    _batchAuxiliaryOutput(_newBatchData, _stateDiffHash, _blobCommitments, _blobHashes)
);
```
